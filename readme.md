A performance approach

<br/>

Primes generation is a frequent mathematical problem which needs to develop increasingly optimal algorithms, in this case we show two miller-rabin algorithm implementation strategies.

> **Miller-Rabin** is a probabilistic approch to determinate if a number is prime or not.

The following demo, show us this algoritm trying to fin the first 5000 primes with 12 digits with each strategy.
